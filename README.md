# Killer Whale Resequencing
A repository for genomic work on Canadian Arctic killer whales, organized by two projects: 
1. Demography and population structure (n=29)
2. Adaptation (n=70+)

## Demography
Notes: Samples were mapped to reference genome accession #GCA_000331955.1 and processed following Foote et al. 2016. Genomic variants were called by Matt Thorstensen using FreeBayes. ABBA BABBA statistics completed by Andy Foote.

Repository contents:
* Filtering and preparing SNP datasets for analyses
* Site map
* Kinship analysis with MLE
* Population structure (PCA, FST, sNMF)
* Runs of Homozygosity (ROH)
* Demographic history with SMC++ and GONE
* Estimating contemporary Ne with StrataG

## Adaptation
* Samples were mapped to updated reference genome accession #GCA_937001465.1 (chromosome-level updated in 2022)
  
In progress
