# Killer Whale Resequencing
A repository for genomic work on Canadian Arctic killer whales, organized by two projects: 
1. Demography and population structure (n=29)
2. Adaptation (n=70+)

## Demography
Notes: Samples were mapped to reference genome accession #GCA_000331955.1 and processed following Foote et al. 2016. Global analyses completed by Andy Foote (https://github.com/AndrewDFoote/Orcanomics)

Repository contents:
1) Calling genomic variants with FreeBayes, script by Matt Thorstensen
2) Filtering and preparing SNP datasets for analyses
3) Site map
4) Kinship analysis with MLE
5) Population structure (PCA, FST)
6) Population structure (admixture) (sNMF)
7) Runs of Homozygosity (ROH)
8) Demographic history with GONE
9) Demographic history with SMC++ (in the "smcpp" folder)
10) Estimating contemporary Ne with StrataG

## Adaptation
* Samples were mapped to updated reference genome accession #GCA_937001465.1 (chromosome-level updated in 2022)
  
In progress
